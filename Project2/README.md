Steps to test the prototype:
-Navigate to StudyBuddyLoFi.pdf
-Download the pdf
-Ignore slide1 and move directly to slide 2 
-Here you are able to navigate through the prototype by clicking the links (clickable links are notated)

In this prototype you are not directed which link to click when on purpose, we need a critical thinking on what is wrong with the navigation. The purpose is how you will navigate through the app on your own.
